Description: # sddk
        
        This is a Python package for writting and reading files to/from [sciencedata.dk](https://sciencedata.dk/). It is especially designed for working with shared folders. It relies mainly upon Python requests library.
        
        sciencedata.dk is a project managed by [DEiC](https://www.deic.dk) (Danish e-infrastrcture cooperation) aimed to offer a robust data storage, data management and data publication solution for researchers in Denmark and abroad (see [docs](https://sciencedata.dk/sites/user/) and [dev](https://sciencedata.dk/sites/developer/) for more info). The storage is accessible either through (1)  the web interface, (2) WebDAV clients or (3) an API relaying on HTTP Protocol. One of the strength of sciencedata.dk is that it currently supports institutional login from 2976 research and educational institutions around the globe (using [WAYF](https://www.wayf.dk/en/about)). That makes it a perfect tool for international research collaboration. 
        
        The main functionality of the package is in uploading any Python object (str, dict, list, dataframe or figure) as a file to a preselected shared folder and getting it back into a Python environemnt as the original Python object. It uses sciencedata.dk API in combination with Python requests library.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        * requests
        * pandas
        * matplotlib
        * getpass
        * BeautifulSoup
        
        ### Install and import
        
        To install and import the package within your Python environment (i.e. a jupyter notebook) run:
        
        ```python
        !pip install sddk # to be updated, use flag "--ignore-installed"
        import sddk ### import all functions
        ```
        
        ###  Session configuration
        
        To run the main configuration function below, you have to know the following:
        * your sciencedata.dk username (e.g. "123456@au.dk" or "kase@zcu.cz"),
        * your sciencedata.dk password (has to be previously configured in the sciencedata.dk web interface),
        
        In the case you want to access a shared folder, you further need:
        
        * **name** of the shared folder you want to access (e.g. "our_shared_folder"),
        
        * **username** of the owner of the folder (if it is not yours)
        
        (Do not worry, you will be asked to input these values interactively while running the function)
        
        To configure a personal session, run:
        ```python
        conf = sddk.configure()
        ```
        
        
        ### Configuration of a session with shared folder
        
        To configure a session pointing to a shared folder, run:
        
        ```python
        conf = sddk.configure("our_shared_folder", "owner_username@au.dk")
        ```
        Running this function, you configure a tuple varible `conf`, containing two objects:
        * `s`: a request session authorized by your username and password
        * `sddk_url`: default url address (endpoint) for your requests
        
        `conf` is later on used as an input for `write_file()` and `read_file()`.
        
        ### write_file()
        
        The most important components of the package are two continuously developed functions: `write_file(path_and_filename, python_object, conf)` and `read_file(path_and_filename, type_of_object, conf)`. 
        
        So far these functions can be used with several different types of Python objects: `str`, `list`, `dictionary`, pandas' `dataframe` and matplotlib's `figure`. These can be written either as `.txt`, `.json` or `.png` files, based simply upon the filename's ending chosen by the user. Here are simple instances of these python objects to play with:
        
        ```python
        ### Python "str" object
        string_object =  "string content"
        ### Python "list" object
        list_object = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        ### Python "dictionary" object
        dict_object = {"a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c":3 }
        ### Pandas dataframe object
        import pandas as pd
        dataframe_object = pd.DataFrame([("a1", "b1", "c1"), ("a2", "b2", "c2")], columns=["a", "b", "c"]) 
        ### Matplotlib figure object
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        figure_object = plt.figure() # generate object
        plt.plot(range(10)) # fill it by plotted values
        ```
        
        The simplest example is once we want to write a string object into a textfile located at our home folder (Remember, that since the configuration this home folder is contained within the `sddk_url` variable ) 
        
        ```python
        sddk.write_file("test_string.txt", string_object, conf)
        ```
        
        In the case  that everything is fine, you will receive following message:
        
        ```
        > Your <class 'str'> object has been succefully written as "https://sciencedata.dk/files/test_string.txt"
        ```
        
        However, there is a couple of things which might go wrong. You can choose an unsupported python object, a non-existent path or unsupported file format. The function captures some of these cases. For instance, once you run `sddk.write_file("nonexistent_folder/filename.wtf", string_object, conf)`, you will be interactively asked for corrections. First: the function checks whether the path is correct. When corrected to an existent folder (here it is "personal_folder"), the function further inspect whether it has known ending (i.e. `txt`, `json` or `png`). If not, it asks you interactively for correction. Third, it checks whether the folder already contain a file of the same name (to avoid unintended overwritting), and if yes, asks you what to do. Finally, it prints out where you can find your file and what type of object it encapsulates. 
        
        ```
        >>> The path is not valid. Try different path and filename: personal_folder/textfile.wtf
        >>> Unsupported file format. Type either "txt", "json", or "png": txt
        >>> A file with the same name ("textfile.txt") already exists in this location.
        Press Enter to overwrite it or choose different path and filename: personal_folder/textfile2.txt
        >>> Your <class 'str'> object has been succefully written as "https://sciencedata.dk/files/personal_folder/textfile2.txt"
        ```
        
        The same function works with dictionaries, lists, Matplotlib's figures and especially Pandas' dataframes. Pandas' dataframe is my favorite. I send there and back 1GB+ dataframes as json files on a daily basis. 
        
        ### read_file()
        
        On the other side, we have the function `sddk.read_file(path_and_filename, object_type)`, which enables us to to read our files back to python as chosen python objects. Currently, the function can read only textfiles as strings, and json files as either dictionary, lists or Pandas's dataframes. You have to specify the type of object as the second argument, the values are either "str", "list", "dict" or "df" within quotation marks, like in these examples:
        
        ```python
        string_object = read_file("test_string.txt", "str", conf)
        string_object
        >>> 'string content'
        ```
        
        ```python
        list_object = read_file("simple_list.json", "list", conf)
        list_object
        >>> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        ```
        
        ```python
        dict_object = read_file("simple_dict.json", "list", conf)
        dict_object
        >>> {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
        ```
        
        ```python
        dataframe_object = read_file("simple_df.json", "df", conf)
        >>>     a   b   c
        0  a1  b1  c1
        1  a2  b2  c2
        ```
        
        ### list_filenames()
        
        This function enables you to list all files within a directory. You can specify the directory, type of the file you are interested in and the conf variable. For instance, the function belows returns all JSON files within your main directory.
        
        ```python
         sddk.list_filenames(filetype="json", conf=conf)
        ```
        
        
        
        ### PUT and GET requests in detail
        
        In the core of  the`write_file()`function is the PUT request command. Here is  what it basically does in the case of different types of objects:
        
        ##### String to TXT
        
        Upload (export) simple text file:
        
        ```python
        s = conf[0]
        sddk_url = conf[1]
        s.put(sddk_url + "testfile.txt", data="textfile content")
        ```
        
        Get it back (import) to Python:
        
        ```python
        string_testfile = ast.literal_eval(s.get(sddk_url + "testfile.txt").text)
        print(string_testfile)
        ```
        
        ##### Pandas DataFrame to JSON
        
        Upload a dataframe as a json file:
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.DataFrame([("a1", "b1", "c1"), ("a2", "b2", "c2")], columns=["a", "b", "c"]) 
        s.put(sddk_url + "df.json", data=df.to_json())
        ```
        
        Get it back:
        
        ```python
        df = pd.DataFrame(s.get(sddk_url + "df.json").json())
        ```
        
        ##### Pandas DataFrame to CSV
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.DataFrame([("a1", "b1", "c1"), ("a2", "b2", "c2")], columns=["a", "b", "c"]) 
        df.to_csv("df.csv") ### temporal file
        s.put(sddk_url + "df.csv", data = open("df.csv", 'rb'))
        ```
        
        ##### Dictionary to JSON
        
        To sciencedata.dk:
        
        ```python
        dict_object = {"a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c":3 }
        s.put(sddk_url + "dict_file.json", data=json.dumps(dict_object))
        ```
        
        From sciencedata.dk:
        
        ```python
        dict_object = json.loads(s.get(sddk_url + "dict_file.json").content)
        ```
        
        ##### Matplotlib figure to PNG
        
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        fig = plt.figure()
        plt.plot(range(10))
        fig.savefig('temp.png', dpi=fig.dpi) ### works even in Google colab
        s.put(sddk_url + "temp.png", data = open("temp.png", 'rb'))
        ```
        
        ### Next steps
        - check string writing and reading
        - enabling blind reading of files 
        - Impement `list_files_in_dir(dirpath, conf)` function (see `sdam-au/OCR/scripts/read_ocr_jsons.ipynb`).
